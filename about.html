	<h2>History</h2>
	<p>I started programming almost five years ago now, in the fall of 2016. Back then, like a lot of other people I know, I had a horribly wrong idea of programming. I thought programming was just typing in a few lines of code and bam! You&rsquo;ve got yourself a new <span class="help" title="A game from a major publisher with a big budget and lots of marketing">AAA</span> title released (sometimes it seems to me like we&rsquo;re almost there already with things like the <a href="https://unrealengine.com">Unreal</a> engine).</p>
	<p>At the time I was taking programming lessons once a week with a few friends of mine. But after the first few lessons, our teacher got sick, and that&rsquo;s the point where most of my comrades stopped programming. But not me! You would&rsquo;ve thought we were using something like <a href="https://python.org">Python</a>, but in fact, our teacher had shown us a program called <cite>Scratch</cite>. And that&rsquo;s where my story began &hellip;</p>

	<h3>Starting from Scratch</h3>
	<p>For anyone who doesn&rsquo;t know, <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> is an online platform for creating simple video games and animations. In contrast to other programming languages, Scratch uses a simple drag-and-drop system to quickly snap together scripts and test them without ever having to type or compile a program. The first weekend after the lessons had started, I spent almost 48 hours on the computer, skimming YouTube for tutorials and replicating the games I found there block by block. Without even knowing it, I was slowly learning and understanding what those programs did and how they worked.</p>
	<p>A few weeks later I was already coding along my first <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Raycaster">raycaster</a> using <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/List">lists</a> and <a href="https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/My_Blocks">custom blocks</a> which I barely understood at the time (and to be honest, was kind of scared of). After having made a 3D rotating cube for which you would&rsquo;ve needed a PhD in Mathematics to have actually known what you were doing, I returned to my sweet spot: platformers. Scratch already has a few built-in blocks for collision detection, and doing everything else myself, I quickly finished my first scrolling platformer. I also did a few other projects, but then it dawned on me &hellip;</p>
	<p>I had to create an account. Most people probably do that the moment they decide to use a website for a long period of time, but I&rsquo;m not most people. I&rsquo;m freakish when it comes to privacy, and not to mention, I just hadn&rsquo;t created any online accounts up to that point; that was simply one of my basic principles of life. It cost myself quite a lot of effort, and I just can&rsquo;t stress enough how important this step was (for me, but also for the story).</p>
	<p>So, I created an account, called it <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/TC-Studios">TC-Studios</a>, and uploaded a few of my already finished projects. Have I lost you yet? No? Then let&rsquo;s move on!</p>
	<p>A while later I decided to participate in a <span class="help" title="A competition where you have a short amount of time to create the best game you possibly can matching a given theme">game jam</span> called TAG and submitted my newly created game <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/198127533/">DOT</a> which, in hindsight, is probably my best (completed) game up to now. Only the best ten Scratchers were allowed to move on to the second round though, and I, being only 13th place, saw no chance of progressing any further. But slowly, in a span of three weeks, three whole people dropped out, and so the host asked me to participate. That&rsquo;s when I created my to this day second best game called <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/209842368/">Galaxy Striker</a>. It was a lot more complicated than my first entry, using only a single main loop and having tons of tiny visual easter eggs.</p>
	<p>All that happened about three years ago. Most games on the website have the simplicity of my first entry and are nevertheless, or rather precisely because of that, extremely fun and addictive to play. Knowing that, it seems like no surprise that &hellip; TODO</p>
