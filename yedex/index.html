	<h1>Yedex [WIP]</h1>
	<p>Yedex is a feature-rich <strong>formatted</strong> text editor for <a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a>, planned to be released <strong>open-source</strong> this fall and containing <u>no ads or popups</u>. Some of the included features are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Find and Replace</li>
		<li>Automatic Quote Placement</li>
		<li>Auto Indent and</li>
		<li>Exporting Files as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode">BBCode</a> and <span class="help" title="Plain text, Markdown, Rich Text Format, Wikitext and AsciiDoc are also planned">More</span></li>
	</ul>
	<p>In contrast to many other mobile text editors, Yedex requires no <u>premium</u> version or similar to unlock all features. Online syncing is <b>not</b> planned, but might be added in a future update.</p>

	<p>There are already thousands of text editors out there. That being said, why did I have to make one of my own? That&rsquo;s a very good question, and I&rsquo;ll try to answer it like this:</p>
	<p>When you first start programming, it opens up a whole new world of possibilities to you. Whether you wanted to learn a programming language because of a specific project, a class in school or just out of boredom, right off the bat you always get a ton of ideas for what you could be making, even if you should first learn some other important stuff like <em>how to actually code in the language</em>.</p>
	<p>In my specific case, I started thinking about custom programming languages, operating systems and: text editors. There are always some <em>tiny</em> tweaks you want your variation of the program to have, and for me (as a perfectionist) that was &hellip; Well, intricate stuff no normal user would ever recognize existed. I would always make some tests and sketches of how those projects would look and feel, but of course I knew that I wasn&rsquo;t nearly experienced enough to actually finish any of them. So, I instead started work on some realistic projects and continued theorizing about the others in the background. If you&rsquo;ve read my <a href="../history.html">history</a> page, you&rsquo;ll already how that ended.</p>
	<p>Now, three years have passed and it&rsquo;s January 2021. The Corona pandemic has hit the world and you&rsquo;re &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to stay inside. <cite>As if programmers would ever do something different,</cite> you think to yourself. You have no active projects at the moment, and so you decide to open Android Studio and create a new project. This time: a text editor the world has never seen before! Fits quite well with the whole &ldquo;Corona&rdquo; theme, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
	<p>The project I created then was my first attempt of what&rsquo;s now called &ldquo;Yedex&rdquo; and the code used there I cleverly recycled for very early prototypes of the final app. The problem with my first version was that I started with the file overview screen. I wanted to make a text editor and started with a file overview screen, especially when I already knew I&rsquo;m infamous for not finishing any of my projects! As you might guess, I gave up two weeks later. And created a new version. This time, I started with the actual editor part of the app and had an overall very minimalistic plan for the project. I tried out a few features and then restarted the project <em>again</em>.</p>
	<p>What I haven&rsquo;t told you so far is that I had set myself a goal for this project: <cite>Finish it, or give up on programming</cite>. And I <em>really</em> did not want to give up on programming. That way I persisted throughout the whole project. I might have been a little less motivated at times, but that usually faded away again quite quickly and I continued with my quest to finish this project. The original goal for this version was similar to the second one: One screen for the editor, one for settings, done. Formatted text was one of the requirements for my project, so I had planned simple <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/slack/">Slack-like</a> markdown to omit the need for extra dialogs. In the original version, I had actually intended there to be only one global file which could then be divided into chapters by the user, all just to leave out the file overview screen.</p>
